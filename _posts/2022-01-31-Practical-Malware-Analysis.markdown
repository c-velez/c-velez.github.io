# Practical Malware Analysis

The next couple of months and posts will focus on my journey in to learning malware analysis. Currently I am enrolled in a Malware Analysis Course at University. The course will cover topics in basic static and dynamic analysis techniques, as well as Reverse Engineering and Debugging. To help enhance our learning, the required reading is the [*Practical Malware Analysis*](http://nostarch.com/malware) book by Andrew Honig and Michael Sikorski.   
   
This series of posts will serve as a way to document my learning, using the exercises in the book as a vehicle for discovery. My intent is not to post homework solutions, but rather to display what I am learning and what I have learned. The layout of these posts will be by chapter (if the chapter has exercises, they will be represented in these posts) in a question, explanation, answer report form.   
   
I hope you find this informative and insightful. Please feel free to reach out with any questions or suggestions!
