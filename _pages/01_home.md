<h2>Welcome</h2>

<p>Welcome to my online presence.<br><br>

I am a United States Air Force Veteran looking for opportunities in Cyber Security and Cyberspace Operations in the Orlando area. Specifically, my areas of interest include malware analysis, digital forensics and incident response, red team operations, and threat intelligence. During my 6.5 years of service, I have developed a strong skill set of leadership and management, operational and strategic planning, and have gained an understanding of complex technical problem sets. I am a results-driven technical leader able to perform in high-stakes and high-pressure environments to achieve desired corporate and enterprise objectives. I am looking for opportunities to expand and apply my technical skill set in Cyber Security.<br><br>

This page is meant to be a space to explore various topics in cybersecurity.
This is a way for me to learn as well as share knowledge with the community.
I will be doing this through doing write ups for CTFs and challenges I participate it,
as well as write ups for various technical books I am working through.
Hope this is as useful for you as it is for me.
